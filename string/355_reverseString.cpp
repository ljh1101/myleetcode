/*
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {

    }
